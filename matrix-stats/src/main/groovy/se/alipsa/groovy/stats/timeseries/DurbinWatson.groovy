/**
 * the Durbinâ€“Watson statistic is a test statistic used to detect the presence of autocorrelation at lag 1 in
 * the residuals (prediction errors) from a regression analysis. It is named after James Durbin and Geoffrey Watson.
 * The small sample distribution of this ratio was derived by John von Neumann (von Neumann, 1941).
 * Durbin and Watson (1950, 1951) applied this statistic to the residuals from least squares regressions,
 * and developed bounds tests for the null hypothesis that the errors are serially uncorrelated against the
 * alternative that they follow a first order autoregressive process.
