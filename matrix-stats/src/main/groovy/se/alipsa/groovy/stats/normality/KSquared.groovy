/**
 * D'Agostino's K2 test, named for Ralph D'Agostino, is a goodness-of-fit measure of departure from normality,
 * that is the test aims to gauge the compatibility of given data with the null hypothesis that the data is a
 * realization of independent, identically distributed Gaussian random variables.
 * The test is based on transformations of the sample kurtosis and skewness, and has power only against the
 * alternatives that the distribution is skewed and/or kurtic.
