/**
 * The Dickeyâ€“Fuller test tests the null hypothesis that a unit root is present in an autoregressive (AR)
 * time series model. The alternative hypothesis is different depending on which version of the test is used,
 * but is usually stationarity or trend-stationarity.
 * The test is named after the statisticians David Dickey and Wayne Fuller, who developed it in 1979.
