/**
 * The Andersonâ€“Darling test is a statistical test of whether a given sample of data is drawn from a
 * given probability distribution. In its basic form, the test assumes that there are no parameters to
 * be estimated in the distribution being tested, in which case the test and its set of critical values
 * is distribution-free.
