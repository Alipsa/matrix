/**
 * A portmanteau test is a type of statistical hypothesis test in which the null hypothesis is well specified,
 * but the alternative hypothesis is more loosely specified.
 * Tests constructed in this context can have the property of being at least moderately powerful against a
 * wide range of departures from the null hypothesis. Thus, in applied statistics, a portmanteau test
 * provides a reasonable way of proceeding as a general check of a model's match to a dataset where there
 * are many different ways in which the model may depart from the underlying data generating process.
 * Use of such tests avoids having to be very specific about the particular type of departure being tested.

   * lags, and is therefore a portmanteau test.
