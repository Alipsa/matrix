/**
 * Barnard’s test is an exact test used in the analysis of 2 × 2 contingency tables with one margin fixed.
 * Barnard’s tests are a class of hypothesis tests, also known as unconditional exact tests for two independent binomials.
 * These tests examine the association of two categorical variables and are often a more powerful alternative
 * than Fisher's exact test for 2 × 2 contingency tables.
 * See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard%27s_test for more info.
