/**
 * The Chow test proposed by econometrician Gregory Chow in 1960, is a test of whether the true coefficients
 * in two linear regressions on different data sets are equal.
 * In econometrics, it is most commonly used in time series analysis to test for the presence of a structural
 * break at a period which can be assumed to be known a priori (for instance, a major historical event such as a war).
 *
 * In program evaluation, the Chow test is often used to determine whether the independent variables have
 * different impacts on different subgroups of the population.
