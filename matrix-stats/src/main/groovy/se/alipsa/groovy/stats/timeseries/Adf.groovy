 * The augmented Dickey–Fuller test (ADF) tests the null hypothesis that a unit root is present in a time series sample.
 * The alternative hypothesis is different depending on which version of the test is used,
 * but is usually stationarity or trend-stationarity.
 * It is an augmented version of the Dickey–Fuller test for a larger and more complicated set of time series models.
