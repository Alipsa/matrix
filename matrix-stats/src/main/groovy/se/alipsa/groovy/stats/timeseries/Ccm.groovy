/**
 * Convergent cross mapping (CCM) is a statistical test for a cause-and-effect relationship between two
 * variables that, like the Granger causality test, seeks to resolve the problem that correlation does not
 * imply causation. While Granger causality is best suited for purely stochastic systems where the influences
 * of the causal variables are separable (independent of each other), CCM is based on the theory of dynamical
 * systems and can be applied to systems where causal variables have synergistic effects.
 *
 * As such, CCM is specifically aimed to identify linkage between variables that can appear uncorrelated with
 * each other.
