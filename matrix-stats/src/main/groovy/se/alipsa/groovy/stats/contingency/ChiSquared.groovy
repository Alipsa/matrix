 * A chi-squared test (also chi-square or Ï‡2 test) is a statistical hypothesis test
 * used in the analysis of contingency tables when the sample sizes are large.
 * In simpler terms, this test is primarily used to examine whether two categorical variables
 * (two dimensions of the contingency table) are independent in influencing the test statistic
 * (values within the table).[1] The test is valid when the test statistic is chi-squared distributed
 * under the null hypothesis, specifically Pearson's chi-squared test and variants thereof.
 * The different types are
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Pearson</li>
 *   <li>Yates</li>
 *   <li>likelihood ratio (G-test)</li>
 *   <li>portmanteau test in time series</li>
