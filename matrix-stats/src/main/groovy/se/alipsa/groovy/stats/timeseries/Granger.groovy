/**
 * The Granger causality test is a statistical hypothesis test for determining whether one time series is
 * useful in forecasting another, first proposed in 1969. Ordinarily, regressions reflect "mere" correlations,
 * but Clive Granger argued that causality in economics could be tested for by measuring the ability to
 * predict the future values of a time series using prior values of another time series.
