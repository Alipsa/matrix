/**
 * the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test (CMH) is a test used in the analysis of stratified or matched categorical data.
 * It allows an investigator to test the association between a binary predictor or treatment and a binary outcome
 * such as case or control status while taking into account the stratification.
 * Unlike the McNemar test, which can only handle pairs, the CMH test handles arbitrary strata size.
 * It is named after William G. Cochran, Nathan Mantel and William Haenszel.
