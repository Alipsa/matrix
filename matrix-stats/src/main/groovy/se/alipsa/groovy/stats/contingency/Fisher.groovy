/**
 * Fisher's exact test is a statistical significance test used in the analysis of contingency tables.
 * Although in practice it is employed when sample sizes are small, it is valid for all sample sizes.
 * It is named after its inventor, Ronald Fisher, and is one of a class of exact tests,
 * so called because the significance of the deviation from a null hypothesis (e.g., p-value) can be calculated exactly,
 * rather than relying on an approximation that becomes exact in the limit as the sample size grows to infinity,
 * as with many other statistical tests.
