/**
 * Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) tests are used for testing a null hypothesis that an observable
 * time series is stationary around a deterministic trend (i.e. trend-stationary) against the alternative
 * of a unit root.
 *
 * Contrary to most unit root tests, the presence of a unit root is not the null hypothesis but the alternative.
 * Additionally, in the KPSS test, the absence of a unit root is not a proof of stationarity but, by design,
 * of trend-stationarity.
