/**
 * the Johansen test, named after Søren Johansen, is a procedure for testing cointegration of several,
 * say k, I(1) time series.
 * This test permits more than one cointegrating relationship so is more generally applicable than the
 * Engle–Granger test which is based on the Dickey–Fuller (or the augmented) test for unit roots in the
 * residuals from a single (estimated) cointegrating relationship.
 *
 * There are two types of Johansen test, either with trace or with eigenvalue,
 * and the inferences might be a little bit different.
