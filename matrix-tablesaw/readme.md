# Matrix-Tablesaw

Note: this module is work in progress.

Interoperability between Tablesaw and Matrix as well as
various extension to Tablesaw such as BigDecimalColumn,
GTable (which makes Tablesaw Groovier) and
complementary operations to deal with Tablesaw data, e.g. the ability to create frequency tables,
Normalize tablesaw columns etc.

See The [tutorial section on Tablesaw](../docs/tutorial/14-matrix-tablesaw.md) and [test.alipsa.groovy.datautil.TableUtilTest](https://github.com/perNyfelt/data-utils/blob/master/src/test/groovy/test/alipsa/groovy/datautil/TableUtilTest.groovy)
