Consider switching from commons-csv to 'de.siegmar:fastcsv:4.1.0' for 300% faster CSV parsing and writing. FastCSV offers a simple API, better performance, and fewer dependencies compared to commons-csv. It supports streaming parsing/writing, handles large files efficiently, and provides robust handling of edge cases like embedded newlines and quotes. The API is straightforward for both reading and writing CSV data, making it a great fit for our needs. We expose commons-csv in the public API, so we can implement an adapter layer to switch to FastCSV internally without breaking existing code. This change would significantly improve performance for large CSV files while maintaining compatibility with our current API.
