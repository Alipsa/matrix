# Matrix-Smile v0.2.0 Roadmap

### Advanced ML Features
- Neural networks (Smile MLP integration)
- SVM support (Support Vector Machines)
- Gradient boosting (XGBoost integration)
- Ensemble methods beyond Random Forest

### Model Persistence
- Model serialization/deserialization
- Save trained models to disk
- Load pre-trained models
- Export models to standard formats (PMML, ONNX)

### Time Series Analysis
- ARIMA models
- Seasonal decomposition
- Forecasting utilities
- Rolling window operations

### Additional Distributions
- More probability distributions (Beta, Gamma, etc.)
- Distribution fitting beyond Weibull
- Q-Q plot generation

### Performance Optimizations
- Parallel processing for large datasets
- Streaming data support
- GPU acceleration (if Smile adds support)

## Notes

- The module interfaces with Smile ML library (version 4.4.2), which uses primitive doubles for performance
- Some Java Math usage and .doubleValue() calls are justified for ML performance
- Module is constrained to Java 21 maximum due to Smile 4.x compatibility
- **Groovy 5.0+ is required** 
  - Modern switch expression syntax (arrow operators) used in DataframeConverter.groovy requires Groovy 5.0+
  - This aligns with other matrix modules that use modern arrow-style switch statements
  - Project uses Groovy 5.0.4 in dependencies.gradle, uses `compileOnly` scope for flexibility
