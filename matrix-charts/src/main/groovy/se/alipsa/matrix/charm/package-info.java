/**
 * Charm is a rethinking of how to build Charts.
 * Charm charts will be svg charts and then have converters
 * for javafx, swing, and PNG. Styling is CSS based.
 * The idea is something modular so that it would be easy to draw a line on a bar chart or
 * a regression line on a shatter plot etc.
 * Each chart element is drawn on top of the other similar to how charts are drawn in base R.
